## üìä Database Testing

### Stored Procedure Testing

Execute these SQL queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

#### 1. Test create_patient
```sql
SELECT create_patient(
  'Test',
  'User',
  'test@example.com',
  '(555) 111-2222',
  '1985-03-20',
  '789 Pine St',
  'Emergency Contact',
  '(555) 222-3333',
  'Insurance Co',
  'POL12345'
);
```

#### 2. Test schedule_appointment
```sql
SELECT schedule_appointment(
  'patient-uuid',
  'doctor-uuid',
  '2024-12-20'::date,
  '10:00:00'::time,
  30,
  'Test appointment'
);
```

#### 3. Test get_available_time_slots
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_available_time_slots(
  'doctor-uuid',
  '2024-12-20'::date,
  30
);
```

#### 4. Test create_invoice_with_services
```sql
SELECT create_invoice_with_services(
  'appointment-uuid',
  ARRAY['service-uuid-1', 'service-uuid-2']::uuid[],
  ARRAY[1, 2]::int[],
  ARRAY[150.00, 75.00]::decimal[],
  ARRAY[0, 10]::decimal[],
  'Test invoice'
);
```

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Cannot read property of undefined"
**Cause**: Data not loaded before component renders
**Solution**: Add null checks or use Angular's async pipe

### Issue 2: "Time slot not available" when it appears free
**Cause**: Time zone mismatch or incorrect time calculation
**Solution**: Verify date/time handling in both frontend and backend

### Issue 3: Invoice total calculation incorrect
**Cause**: Discount applied incorrectly or tax not calculated
**Solution**: Review calculation logic in billing component and stored procedure

### Issue 4: CORS error when calling API
**Cause**: Frontend origin not in AllowedOrigins
**Solution**: Add frontend URL to CORS configuration in Program.cs

## ‚úÖ Test Coverage Goals

- **Backend**: 80% code coverage
- **Frontend Components**: 70% code coverage
- **Critical Paths**: 100% covered
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints
- **E2E Tests**: Main user workflows

## üéØ Testing Best Practices

1. **Test Early, Test Often**: Run tests after each significant change
2. **Automate Where Possible**: Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Don't just test happy paths
4. **Keep Tests Independent**: Each test should run in isolation
5. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for database and external APIs in unit tests
6. **Document Test Cases**: Clear descriptions help maintain tests
7. **Review Test Failures**: Don't ignore failing tests
8. **Test Performance**: Monitor response times and optimize slow queries

**Happy Testing! üß™**
